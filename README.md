# dicey

This is a basic experiment in using machine learning to identify images of dice. It is written in python, and uses the TensorFlow library.

# First phase

This will involve identifying the shape of a die, with the following restrictions:

* There will be exactly one die in the image (not zero and not multiples).
* The die will be one of a common RPG set, i.e. d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20.
* The symbols on the faces will be numerals (not pips or other symbols).
